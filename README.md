Project Source is a website designed to allow users to find new and interesting coding projects.  Users can add new projects to the database and search by title, skills, or interests to find their next project idea.  The goal is to give new and experienced coders new ideas and projects to try.

To use this code you will need:
Node JS
PostgreSQL

After installing node and postgres enter postgres and copy paste the main.sql file into the postgres terminal.

In a terminal launch the local server with the command:
node server.js

The site will now be available at:
localhost:3000/

HAVE FUN!
